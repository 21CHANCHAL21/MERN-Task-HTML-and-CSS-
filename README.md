# MERN-Task-Set1-(HTML-and-CSS)-

Welcome to my HTML practice repository! I've been assigned a series of tasks that I've completed using only HTML. The primary objective is to gain an advanced command of HTML through dedicated practice. This README file serves as a guide to my progress and the tasks I've completed.

Tasks Overview
In each of the following tasks, I've utilized pure HTML to complete various challenges:

Task 1: Semantic HTML
In this task, I focused on using semantic HTML elements to structure and organize content. I learned how to create meaningful markup that improves accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

Task 2: Forms and Input Elements
I delved into the world of HTML forms and various input elements. This task involved creating user-friendly forms and exploring different input types like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns.

Task 3: CSS Styling
This task revolved around applying CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to my HTML documents. I practiced selecting elements and applying styles to enhance the visual appeal of my web pages.

Task 5: Links and Navigation
I worked on creating navigational elements like menus and links, purely through HTML. Understanding anchor tags and creating a clear and user-friendly navigation structure was the key objective.

Task 6: Multimedia and Embedding
This task explored the integration of multimedia elements such as images and videos into my HTML documents without any external tools or languages.
